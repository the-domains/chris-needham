So I've been trying Huel[https://huel.com/][0] over the last month, mainly if I don't get time to make breakfast or a packed lunch. Have to say, it's been pretty good. Of course, it's not as good as making and eating a proper meal, but it is **effective as a meal substitute** to make sure you get the right nutrients at the right time into you and don't get tempted to hit the junk. 

I tried it for breakfast and lunch on a couple of occasions and was adequately satisfied without any hunger pangs till I could get dinner. The taste is as they say, vanilla and fortunately, I do like vanilla. It is mixed with cold water and you do need to make sure that you **shake it or mix it well** because otherwise it can be lumpy which isn't pleasant. They provide a decent shaker (if you buy at least 28 meals worth) that has a good design - incorporating a sort of grate to shake the water and powder through which generally ensures a smooth outcome.

There is a lot of good information on nutrition on their site and other uses in recipes which I will be trying over the next few weeks - tomorrow I'll be incorporating into my pancake mix to see how it turns out. 

If you are generally interested in nutrition and also potentially saving the planet (bit grand at this stage, but it is part of their mission) I'd certainly give it a go. You can get a sample (but this is quite highly priced at £4) or you can just go for 28 meals worth for £45 which works out at £1.61 a meal. Not bad!
