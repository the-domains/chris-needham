## You need engagement - not lip service, because if the project is not built as intended and as priced, the potential negative commercial implications can be huge. 

As a Project Planner, the general process is to **gather, organise, agree and communicate **the project programme info successfully to people - **Get people into it. **

Even though the Gantt chart has been in use for over a century, the production of a project programme used to (_and may still_) be described as a 'Black Art' in the Construction Industry. **People just don't get it **-_"just looks like a mess of bars and links. Why do I need that?!" _

Some Project Managers and site teams more often than not **don't follow the road map **that is provided to them too closely for a multitude of reasons, but mainly due to fact that the communication of it has been unsuccessful - **they just don't buy it. **

**How do I know this? **Because I've **failed to get buy in **on several occasions. That programme sat in the drawer and they went off and did their own thing which, most of the time, became a **disaster.**

## How did we communicate the programme intent?

Some people will say they understand when you have said something, but that **'understanding' needs to be tested **and questions need to be invited in order to ensure understanding, because **no one gets it 100% right **on their own and **change is of course inevitable**.

In the past we've tried to do demonstrate our vision by **s****ketching out time slices** of the programme on 2D plans, then putting these into powerpoint slides to present them better **to get feedback.**

Apart from being static and not necessarily capturing all the information, this is **time-consuming **since the programme and the powerpoint slides are **not directly linked**, meaning a change to the programme means having to re-jig all of your slides to make them meaningful again. More recently (_for over a decade already_), we've been doing the same thing with 3D stills to add another dimension for teams to **visualise the programme **intent, but it's basically the same process. 

## So how are we communicating the programme intent better?

**Modern Tools -**advancing so fast we can barely keep up. We have an industry that in many areas, is set in its ways, very slow to change and is not making use of what is available on a big enough scale. This is evident in the fact that there has been software available **on the market for over a decade **now which **removes the disconnect **between programme, and the way we want to visually present it.

**"4D _is _Project Planning" **

What is marketed as '4D' Planning software, 4D being crudely, 3D+Time, is what Construction Planners and Project Managers have been doing separately forever in our heads: **4D is Project Planning. **It allows us to directly link programme information to 3D information and produce a virtual construction of the project as planned.

It gets it **out of our heads **into a format than can be **shared **so that we can invite others closer to the work to give opinion more quickly, incorporate and see the effects of change in real time as the information is directly linked.

Better still, we can view the project as it is planned to be built from any perspective in the model, **at any time in the process**, unearthing things we may not have even considered.

As a method of communication for construction projects and Project Planning in general, this is by far the best tool available to us today. A medium that **engages and interests **the team results in a **more robust programme with team buy in. **This can then be priced correctly as to the way it should be built with people far less likely to go off and do their own thing as they will feel **they own the programme **having had a much greater input. 

As for the programme, the Gantt may still be in that bottom drawer for some people, but the content of and why the programme needs to be run and managed as planned, has the **greatest chance of being engaging**.
