**No Resolutions. Just Be Better...**

**Hello 2016**

On reflection, 2015 was a big year for me personally and professionally. Buying a house and merging a business were the major headlines. Now it's another new year and time to take a good look at myself. What am I really going to change? There is so much I can always improve and so much on the to do list, it's difficult to know where to start.

Perhaps Nike nailed it when they came up with the slogan 'Just Do It' and it really is just as simple as that, a lot of the time. How you interpret that is up to you (as they intended), but sometimes, just doing it is not enough if it lacks a focus or a purpose. I was on a [Maverix][0] snowboarding summer course at Les Deux Alpes in 2013 when Jay Streater (owner and course leader) after demonstrating how to do something which prompted a question from someone on how do it, would jokingly say '**just be better**.' 

Although this was a bit tongue in cheek, he was basically saying try a bit harder, think about and focus on what you're doing and keep chipping away until you get it.

This is really a phrase that embodies continuous improvement. Embracing change, new ideas, trying to do things differently for the better and how that fits into your life both personally and professionally.

But how can you do better? You have to apply yourself.

Got problems with communication? **Just be better** - at finding ways to get your message across. Can't find the time to do what you want to do? **Just be better** - at time management. Scared to fail? Just do it, fail, get over it, work it out and next time - **Just be better**.

Slow down, sort out, reflect and find the root cause of your problem. People will be there to help you, but only if you're prepared to help yourself in the first place. This year, as with every year, I'll try to **just be better...**
